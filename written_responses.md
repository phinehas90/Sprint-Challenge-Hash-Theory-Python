1. What is a regular expression and how does it work?
   Regular expressions are a concise way of searching for specific patterns of characters.
   As an example, when searching for an email address, the engine looks at each character and determines if it matches the regex
   and returns the result.

2. What is an array and how does it work?
   An array is a common data-structure used in programming. Usually comes with it's own built in functionality,
   but it allows us to store like data in an iterable group, which is fine if it's a small array, but looping through
   the whole array when there are thousands of items can kill efficiency, which is where hash tables come in.

3. What is a hash table and how does it work?
   Hash tables are data-structures that use a hashing algorithm to determine at what index an item is placed in an array.
   This negates the need to iterate through the full array, looking for a specific piece of data. If you have the hash, you know where
   the data is.
